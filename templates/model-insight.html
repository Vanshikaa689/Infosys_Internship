      <ul>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 1</time> Project Initialisation and Planning: Planned the project by outlining its key objectives and dividing the tasks into a structured, week-by-week timeline to ensure steady progress. Created an initial blueprint to have a clear overview of the project's scope, deliverables, and execution strategy.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 2</time> Exploration and Acquisition of Data Resources and Initial Research: Collected disaster-related datasets from sources like Kaggle, including fields such as ID, keyword, location, and processed text. Conducted initial research to understand key disaster-related data points and trends.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 3</time> Data Exploration and Cleaning: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and understand the structure of the data. Applied data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 4</time> Data Preprocessing and Balancing: Used techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE to address class imbalance in the dataset. 
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 5</time>Team-Based Exploration:

            The project team was divided into four groups, each handling a specific task:
            
            Team 1: Explored the Twitter API to investigate potential for real-time disaster tweet analysis.
            
            Team 2: Analyzed fake tweets dataset to study patterns in misinformation.
            
            Team 3: Extracted location information and created visual plots to enhance spatial analysis.
            
            Team 4: Focused on further handling unbalanced datasets to improve model performance.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 6</time> Feature Engineering: Implemented tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization for preparing text data for model training. Extracted key features to enhance the accuracy of predictions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 7</time> Model Selection and Development: Experimented with various machine learning models, starting with Logistic Regression for basic classification. Tested and fine-tuned different algorithms to identify the best model for predicting whether a tweet is disaster-related.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 8</time> Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 9</time> Website Development and Integration: Developed a user-friendly website as a platform to showcase the project’s results and insights. Integrated the models and visualizations to create an interactive tool for disaster analysis.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 10</time> Final Testing and Deployment: Conducted final testing of the website and models to ensure functionality and user experience. Deployed the website platform as a consolidated interface for disaster prediction, categorization, and analysis.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 11</time> Project Report and Presentation Preparation: Created a comprehensive project report detailing each stage, methods used, and results. Prepared a presentation summarizing the project’s goals, approach, and outcomes for effective communication with stakeholders.
